Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship Portfolio! In this repository, 
you will find a collection of projects that I have completed during my internship at Codsoft. 
Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving.

Below is a summary of the task: 
Task_1. MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION Description: 
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. 
You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines. 
I chose to use Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression..
